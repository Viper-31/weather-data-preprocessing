### My Contributions
My primary contributions focus on **data preprocessing, quality control, and exploratory analysis** of large-scale ECMWF weather datasets, including:

- Python preprocessing pipelines for ECMWF reanalysis data  
- Cleaning, transformation, and validation of noisy time-series datasets  
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualisation to support data quality control  
- Reproducible workflows using Git, structured notebooks, and scripting best practices  
- Code designed to run efficiently in an HPC environment (Pawsey Supercomputing Centre)

These components support downstream **machine learning–based weather forecasting models** by ensuring reliable, traceable, and well-documented input data.
